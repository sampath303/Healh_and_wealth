            If you are obese,it's extremely important to focus on making sustainable lifestyle changes that promote weight loss and overall health. Extreme obesity can contribute to the development of several serious health conditions, such as Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. The good news is that extreme obesity is manageable and treatable.</p>
        <h3 className='extreme-obese-h3'>Exercise and activity</h3>
        <h4 className='extreme-obese-h6'>Getting more physical activity or exercise is an essential part of obesity treatment:</h4>
        <p className='extreme-obese-p'><u>Exercise:-</u> People with obesity need to get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity physical activity. This can help prevent further weight gain or maintain the loss of a modest amount of weight. You'll probably need to gradually increase the amount you exercise as your endurance and fitness improve.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p className='extreme-obese-p'><u>Keep moving:-</u> Even though regular aerobic exercise is the most efficient way to burn calories and shed excess weight, any extra movement helps burn calories. For example, park farther from store entrances and take the stairs instead of the elevator. A pedometer can track how many steps you take over the course of a day. Many people try to reach 10,000 steps every day. Gradually increase the number of steps you take daily to reach your goal.</p>
